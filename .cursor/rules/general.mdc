# General rules

- Always use `pnpm` when installing packages or doing anything that requires something you'd otherwise use `npm` for
- When writing javascript files always use `// @ts-check` and jsdoc for type support
- after making changes always follow up with running `pnpm test` and then doing concise changes until the test passes. 
- Do not change tests to make the tests pass if you can avoid it
    - Unless you are writing a new test entirely, in that case you can modify the source code.
